One of the most important decisions in a young adult's life is where he or she goes to college.  Often, our decisions are shaped by third-party rankings of universities.  However, there are a plethora of sources such as the Times Higher Education World University Ranking and the Academic Ranking of World Universities that all employ divergent methodologies, resulting in conflicting rankings.  We want to tackle this problem and reduce confusion by analyzing current rankings to determine where they diverge.  Specifically, we want to delve into which aspects of a university are given too much weight, and which aspects are often overlooked.  Every ranking has inherent bias, and we would like to investigate where these biases lie. Ultimately, our goal is to answer the question of how universities stack up against each other.  We hope to provide a singular ranking that aggregates information from other rankings.  This will reduce potential biases and give students a clear, holistic picture into which college is best for his or her needs. We are looking at the World University Rankings data set (https://www.kaggle.com/mylesoneill/world-university-ranking).  Included in this data set is characteristics of each university such as student to staff ratio and a score for research proficiency.  There are also rankings from three major webistes for each year from 2011 to 2016, and we may look to include other sites' rankings.
